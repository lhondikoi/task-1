# Objects in JavaScript
In JavaScript, objects are data stored in key-value pairs. The keys must be strings and the values can be any data type, including another object.
Example:
```js
const person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 38,
    profession: 'Musician',
    hobbies: ['Singing', 'Playing the guitar', 'Travelling']
}
```
